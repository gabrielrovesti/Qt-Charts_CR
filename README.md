# Qt-Charts_CR
OOP Project for visualizing and editing Qt charts made for the OOP Course for CS, Padua

Project done in pairs to allow the visualization and modification of graphs
made with Qt framework.

The project has been evaluated and corrected.
I'll leave the file with comments in case anyone is curious.

Thanks for the attention.
